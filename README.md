# Blueprint Ignition Collection

The blueprint collection is a set of ignition robotics libraries compatible between
each other.

Ignition Robotics brings a fresh approach to simulation with a complete toolbox
of development libraries and cloud services to make simulation easy. Iterate
fast on your new physical designs in realistic environments with high fidelity
sensors streams. Test control strategies in safety, and take advantage of
simulation in continuous integration tests.
